# Proof of Concept: Cypress vs. Playwright for E2E Testing

## Overview

This proof of concept (PoC) evaluates Cypress and Playwright, two popular end-to-end (E2E) testing frameworks. Both tools offer robust UI testing capabilities without requiring access to the underlying application code. Below, I compare their pros, discuss my hands-on experience, and share insights for future improvements.

## Cypress vs. Playwright: Key Comparisons

### Shared Benefits:
- Both are open-source tools, capable of conducting E2E test cases.
- Ideal for UI testing without needing to interact with underlying application code.
  
### Playwright Advantages:
1. **Stronger Support and Community**:
   - Backed by Microsoft and other prominent organizations.
   - Easier integration with modern browsers, including Safari.
   
2. **VS Code Integration**:
   - Playwright integrates seamlessly with Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
   - Its VS Code extension allows users to record browser activities, creating automated test scripts directly from user actions.
   
3. **Advanced Browser Support**:
   - Better support for Electron browsers compared to Cypress.
   - Includes native test generation by recording browser sessions.

### Cypress vs. Playwright in Action:
- While both tools are open-source, Cypress also offers an enterprise version for large-scale use.
- Playwright's JavaScript/TypeScript code structure feels more intuitive and easier to read, especially for developers familiar with these languages.

## Hands-On Experience

### Test Case Creation:
I created test cases for a simple Todo app using both frameworks:
- **Playwright**: 
  - Easier to write test cases, although the difference was not huge.
  - Playwrightâ€™s syntax resembles typical JavaScript/TypeScript code, making it more familiar and readable.
  
- **Cypress**:
  - Also effective but did not offer the same level of browser flexibility (e.g., Electron support).

### Issues Encountered:
When running tests generated in Playwright, I ran into a few issues:
- **Non-Deterministic UI Behavior**: The test failed in scenarios where the user interface was somewhat non-deterministic.
  
This, however, is not entirely negative. These bottlenecks exposed certain overlooked UI issues, helping to identify subtle bugs in the application.

## Future Directions

Despite encountering minor challenges with non-deterministic behavior, Playwright has proven to be a powerful tool for E2E testing. Moving forward, refining the test cases to address UI variability can help enhance the overall robustness of the application.

This comparison highlights the strengths of both Cypress and Playwright, with a clear indication that Playwright's enhanced browser support and VS Code integration make it a slightly more efficient tool for E2E testing in modern web applications.
